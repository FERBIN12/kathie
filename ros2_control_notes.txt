ROS2 control:

    -> packages needed:

    -> The ros2 control package provide feedback from using the controller and system
        basically it is a closed loop control system calculated using error value.

        The ros2 control composed of hardware resources composed of the following:

        -> Actuators
        -> Sensors
        -> Controllers      (Can be hardware or simulated devices)

        To interact with these hardware resources, we have 2 interfaces namely 
            
            1. command interfaces  - for writing commands to the hardware
            2. state interface     - to retrive (read) the state information of the controller

        These two interfaces are managed by resource manager , loads the hardware components 
            to be used by the ros2 control library.

        The controller manager interacts with resource manager as well as the Controllers
            i.e joint trajectory controller or position controller

ROS2 controller:
    The controller logic needd for the ros2 control is given by the this library.


Control types:

    position 
    speed 
    effort
