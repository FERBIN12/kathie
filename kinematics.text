## pose of a mobile robot

    Lets consider our robot is in a 2d plane and so it can move only in the 2d plane
    i.e ; only yw and xw are in the 2d plane

    And the 2d plane of the bot is yr and xr 

    so we need only 3 variables i.e y (wrt world ) , x wrt to world and and angle teta

Translation : (distance)

    Translation vector -- gives the distance b/w reference frame and the world frame.
